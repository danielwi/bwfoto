<h1>Image Search</h1>

<p>Any picture can be found in a variety of ways. With categories, keywords,
image numbers and cross references the images are found.<br>
The philosophy is that the initial search results in something close to the
desired. The precise image are then found by using cross-references.</p>


<p>The simplest way to start searching is to go to the Main Categories.
These are listed, so that the top rows are of Danish images only.
In the middle rows the images are not specific to any country. The lowest
rows is based on country of origin.<br>
You will be transferred to the main categories by clicking on "Bert Wiklund Photographer", or on "TO
MAIN CATEGORIES"</p>


<p>Each main category is divided into several sub categories. It often pays of
to review all sub categories, when searching for a specific image.<br>
Click on a sub category that looks promising and start browsing the
thumbnails. The top slideshow are now whith images of that particular sub category.
By clicking on a thumbnail you will get a pop-up window with the image at
larger scale. In this window, you will be presented with info on the image,
by keywords under the headline Info/Keyword. All keywords are links and
cross references to images associated with that particular word.
The categories listed under Categories works in the same way.</p>


<h2>Search by keywords</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind that the English version of this site is not yet 100% complete
Although it is possible to search using the Danish keywords, only scientific name will be
visible when viewing species in preview mode. <em>Please use Category searching by
clicking on "Bert Wiklund Photographer"</em>
The search function does not distinguish between upper- and lowercase.<br>
After you have typed three letters in the input field, you will be shown a
list of suggestions matching the word (This function is not available on
some older browser and operating systems). Select a word with the arrow keys
on your keyboard, or click on the desired word with your mouse, and press
enter</p>


<h2>Combination of words</h2>
<p>If you want to search for, lets say beechforest with snow, start typing
bee.... ,  if beechforest is on the suggestion list, select it with the
arrow keys and thus filling the input field with beechforest, or simply just
type the whole thing in the input field. Keep in mind that the system
removes any prepositions (with, by, on, etc.) After beechforest add a blank
space and then enter snow and click search. It should be noted that
the suggestion list only lists the suggestions that would produce a result,
this is particularly relevant when entering two or more words. The results
from a search containing more than one word will produce the most matching
images first. Further down the page(s), images only matching two words of a
three word search. In the case of a two word search only images matching
both words will be found.</p>


<h2>Search by wilcard/joker</h2>
<p>The * asterics-character replaces letters. This can be used if you are in
    doubt about spelling. You can also use it instead of endings. If you enter snow* in the search field
    and press search, the results will
    include snowfall, snowball etc. If you put * on both sides of snow you will
    get images associated with a keywords contains snow. The asterisks sign is
    omitted in suggestion searches.<br>
    Example; if you are searching for forest only, you will get no result. All forest are specified as
    spruceforest, oakforest etc.. But by typing *forest, you get all kind of forest.</p>

<h2>Search by image number</h2>
<p>Enter the image number in the input field and click search. If you want to
    search for several image, the numbers must be divided by comma and no blank space
    e.g 123,456,78910</p>


<h2>Search by Latin names</h2>
<p>It is possible to search for both the species and/or genus or the whole
    name.</p>


<p>Foreign locations: As far as possible foreign locations are written in the
    local language.</p>


<p>Search by month alone is not possible, since this would produce too large a
    result. Many sub categories are divided by seasons. It is anyhow possible to search by a month plus
    any other keyword(s).</p>


<p>In some categories there are links to lists, for instance birds, by looking
    up in the list, it is possible to find the species in a more systematic way.</p>
