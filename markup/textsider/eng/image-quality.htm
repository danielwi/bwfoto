<h1>Image quality</h1>
<p>In the table you can see the size etc. of the different Originals. All sizes are minimum. You can experience bigger size sometimes.<br>
Examples of ORIGINAL are shown in natural size with a screen resolution of 1024x768 pixel. All examples are at 100% to print size A4 (long side 30 cm.) @300ppi.</p>

<p>Downloaded images are in .jpg, with a very gentle 11/12 compresion. This quality can  be printed in full delivered size, without any problem. Images are with Adobe RGB (1998) colorprofile. Optimized for printing without out of gamut. The downloaded images are without any appplied sharpening (Unsharp Maske) Important to pass this information to lay-out/printer.<br>
Merged digital files are of different sizes. Most are around 6000 pixel on the short side. Long side are at a maximum of 30000 pixel, due to limitation of the .jpg-format. If you wish over 30000 pixel in size, it will be delivered as .tif. Print size @300 ppi can roughly be calculated saying that 6000 pixel are 50 cm.
